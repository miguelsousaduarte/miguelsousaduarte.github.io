Publications Working Less for Longer: Unintended Effects of Longevity Adjustment of Retirement Age
International Tax and Public Finance, Volume 32, pages 1076–1105, (2025). Joint with: Svend E. Hougaard Jensen &amp; Thorsteinn Sigurdur Sveinsson
Abstract: Using a macro model with overlapping generations, this paper shows that increasing the retirement age may unintentionally reduce average hours worked (intensive margin), particularly depending on pension system design: the effect is stronger under pay-as-you-go systems with fixed benefits than under those with fixed contributions or voluntary savings.">
