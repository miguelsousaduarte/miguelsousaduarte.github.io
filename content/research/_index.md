My research specializes in Pension Economics, focusing on demographic ageing, labour supply and savings behaviour. I use Danish registry data to study retirement and wealth decisions in the face of policy reforms.

  Abstract: Using a macro model with overlapping generations, this paper shows that increasing the retirement age may unintentionally reduce average hours worked (intensive margin), particularly depending on pension system design: the effect is stronger under pay-as-you-go systems with fixed benefits than under those with fixed contributions or voluntary savings.
